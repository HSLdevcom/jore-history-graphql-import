This is only relevant if you have a zipped JORE export locally. To import the daily export from the FTP server, consult the main readme.

### Locally

Put your zipped JORE export here. Start the Docker container with the `bash` command and run `run_local.sh` in the project root.

### On the server

Find the directory that is used as the `/source` volume for the Docker container and put your zipped JORE export there.
Then start the Docker container with the `bash` command and run `run_local.sh` in the project root.
